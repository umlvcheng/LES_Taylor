for: Fortran source code
R0: input and grid files for case with M^2=3e-8, B0=0
R0p1: input and grid files for case with M^2=3e-8, B0=-1.9e-10
R1: input and grid files for case with M^2=3e-8, B0=-1.9e-9
R10: input and grid files for case with M^2=3e-8, B0=-1.9e-8
R0p1_nofront: input and grid files for case with M^2=0, B0=-1.9e-10
R1_nofront: input and grid files for case with M^2=0, B0=-1.9e-9
R10_nofront: input and grid files for case with M^2=0, B0=-1.9e-8
